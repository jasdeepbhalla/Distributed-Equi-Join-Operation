# Distributed-Equi-Join-Operation
Wrote Python Script for executing Inner Joins on multiple tables in a distributed manner using multi-threading in Python. 

Operations implemented in this python file. 
1: Parallel Sort: Sorting the table based on one column given as input using five threads in python

2: Parallel Join: Implementing inner join operation using five threads in python.
