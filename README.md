# Distributed-Equi-Join-Operation
Wrote Python Script for executing Inner Joins on multiple tables in a distributed manner using multi-threading in Python. The operations implemented in this python file are: 

* **Parallel Sort:** Sorting the table based on one column given as input using five threads in python
* **Parallel Join:** Implementing inner join operation using five threads in python.
